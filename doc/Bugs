Bugs

below items are the bugs found during the development. Some may be already
fixed. This table will updated at least before each release.


** Under Win8 with wxpython 3.0, display is wrong for booklist show. Maybe
it just caused by wxpython 3.0, not by Win8 platform. Not tested other platforms yet.

** Under Windows, the dierctories can't include Chinese characters, otherwise
the Config UI doesn't work.
