Introduction

This document will give detail steps to set up the development environment
for BookMate in all 3 platforms: Linux, Windows and OS X.


Section A: Linux

Note: All steps are based on Ubuntu. Other distributions should have very similar
commands.
$ sudo apt-get install pip
$ sudo pip install patool pyinstaller
$ sudo pip install pypdf2 metapdf epubzilla


-----------------------

Section B: Windows

1. Install python and wxpython
2. install pywin32 which is needed by pyinstaller
	2.1 http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
	2.2 can be installed by pip, but not tested yet
3. Install pip:
	3.1  download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
	3.2  cmd> get-pip.py
		or if you need proxy to access the internet:
	     cmd> get-pip.py --proxy="[user:passwd@]proxy.server:port"
4. Install tools (add --proxy="[user:passwd@]proxy.server:port" if needed):
$ sudo pip install patool pyinstaller
$ sudo pip install pypdf2 metapdf epubzilla


-----------------------

Section C: OS X

Since I don't have an OS X machine, I can't give detail steps. Sorry.
However, I think the steps should be similar as Linux, so try it follow
that steps.
