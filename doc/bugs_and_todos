Bugs

below items are the bugs found during the development. Some may be already
fixed. This table will updated at least before each release.


==== MAJOR BUGS ====

** Under Win8 with wxpython 3.0, display is wrong for booklist show. Maybe
it just caused by wxpython 3.0, not by Win8 platform. Not tested other platforms yet.

** Under Windows, the dierctories can't include Chinese characters, otherwise
the Config UI doesn't work.


==== MINOR BUGS ====

** When switch panel, update StatusBar msg accordingly. Could save the last
msg of each panel as their object attribution.


==== TODO ====

Below are items would be consided in future development. I just list them but
won't follow the sequences.

** finish re-name function and same-name function
** support multi-items process
** support path history for search paths and excluded paths in config
** mark extraction failure archive files in RED
** support extraction/rename for individual files from Search Panel
** support ":" in SearchBar for extend syntax
** search same name files from different directories
** extract files with names like 'xxx.rar.000', and maybe more fragment name types
** should BM supports 'ignore user defined directories/filetypes'?
** I'd like to mark files in RED at Search Panel and delete/move them easily
** how about ":star" function?
** improve log and debug functions
** Unit Test
** Linux distributions packages, such as .deb for Debian/Ubuntu
** i18n such as supporting Chinese
** how about Python/WxPython 3.x?
** Don't forget performance, speed is very important
